  "description" : "Alternative Armor Scale, which is included in RPG Growth, has unintended effects on two boss fights; the Erchius Horror becomes vulnerable to conventional attacks, and the Ixodoom's shell becomes extremely ineffective. This fix addresses both by increasing their armor values to appropriate levels; the Erchius Horror is virtually invulnerable, as it should be, and the Ixodoom now has approximately the same damage resistance as originally.",
