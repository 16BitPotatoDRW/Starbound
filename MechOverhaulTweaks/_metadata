  "description" : "Assorted personal tweaks for Mech Overhaul, namely:\n* The Oil Distillery and Fuel Refinery are adjusted to include \"Mech\" in their names so that they will be sorted with other mech-related items in crafting menus.\n* If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131820988]Tech Additions[/url] is installed, Repair Kit is removed from treasure pools and from sale at the tech console - Repair Kit doesn't work with Mech Overhaul, so this change exists to prevent frustration.\n* A small typo is corrected in SAIL's mech tutorial dialogue.",
