  "description" : "A series of tweaks and player stat adjustments intended to offset power-creep brought on by other mods and to draw attention to some underutilized mechanics. The purpose of this mod is to add difficulty where things were detrimentally easy, and not to add difficulty for the sake of difficulty. These changes are detailed below:\n\n\nBetween the ineffctuality of drowning and the ease with which a Breathing EPP is obtained, breath may be the most forgettable mechanic in the game. Drowning damage now takes roughly 8 seconds to kill you, and it takes about 15 seconds to catch your breath, from depletion. The amount of breath you have is not affected by this mod.\n\nFall damage, in a similar vein, does little enough damage that it only becomes relevant when you throw yourself off a cliff. This mod's x1.6 multiplier isn't a massive increase, but it's enough to encourage slowing down and watching where you land.\n\nInvulnerability-on-hit, as it is, trivializes brute-forcing your way out of tough situations. This mod reduces invulnerability time from a full second down to 0.3 seconds; it's enough to allow time to react, but hostiles will be harder to simply ignore.\n\nMovement parameters are slightly adjusted for tighter controls.\n\nFor the most part, you can't move in zero-G. I'm sure you can figure out some entertaining solutions.\n\nThe magical aura of light around the player is reduced to almost nothing. You'll still be aware of yourself, but you'll need a light to see much else.\n\nThe player's base health and energy are set to 90, and their base attack power is set to 80%. This equates to almost exactly 100% at level 1 of corresponding RPG Growth multipliers, e.g, a level 1 Knight will have an attack power of ~100% with broadswords.\n\nEnergy recharge delay has been increased by 0.3 seconds, and recharge rate is decreased such that it takes approximately 4 seconds to recharge from empty. Remember, switching to your melee is faster than recharging.\n\nTrash burn-time has been increased by half a second.\n\nThe food delta has been reduced to two thirds of its normal value, meaning that it takes approximately 30 minutes to begin starving, rather than the vanilla 20 minutes.\n\nThe player receives slightly less knockback, allowing you increased control during combat.",
